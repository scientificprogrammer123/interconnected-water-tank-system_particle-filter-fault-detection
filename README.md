# particle-filter_water-tank_fault-detection
Matlab program to use particle filter to track the state of a three-tank interconnected water tank system to determine the time when a leakage fault occurred.

The main program is run_program_with_leakage_in_tank2_.

The program generates a plot of the measured voltage representing the height of water in the three tanks, modelled voltage representing the height of water in the three tanks, and particle filter tracked voltage representing the height of water in the three tanks. It also generates a plot of the probability of fault occurrence in tank 2, which tells you when the leakage fault occurred in the tank.
